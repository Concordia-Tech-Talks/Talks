# Concordia ENCS (Gina Cody) Discord Tech Talks

## Description
Every 2 weeks we're going to be hosting some tech talks here on the Discord server (join by clicking on the [link here](https://discord.com/invite/concoengrcs)). The talks will be around an hour long and are each about different technologies, tools and techniques. The talks will be streamed in the voice channel `#TechTalk` just below this channel having the same name (`#tech-talk`). If you're interested in them, please drop in and listen and learn something fascinating.

## Schedule
*Exact dates and times will be announced closer to each talk in `#ðŸ“†events`* and will be updated here as much as possible.
